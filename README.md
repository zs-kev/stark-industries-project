About the project:

Stark Industries is having trouble keeping track of all their Iron Man tech and have approached NinjaTech for a simple inventory management web application to assist them. As Tony Stark keeps building and inadvertently destroying so many suits, this application needs to have the flexibility add, modify, and delete stock items on the fly. The application must keep track of various different categories of hardware including fully constructed suits, spare parts, weapons, etc. Tony’s requirements are as follows:
    •	View a page with a list of all categories. He needs to be able to add a new category, edit a category name, and delete a category (but he can only be allowed to delete a category if there are no products in that category). If he clicks into a category, he needs to see a list of products within that category (as below).
    •	The product list page will be viewed per category and will display a table of the following information per product:
        o	 Name
        o	 Description
        o	 Quantity available
    •	Tony needs to be able to create a new product, modify a product, and delete a product
    •	Tony needs to be able to control who has access to the system by creating admin users and assigning them passwords. He should at any time be able to modify or delete a user.

Things to remember:
    •	S.H.I.E.L.D will only sign off on Tony using this system if it meets their security standards. No plain text passwords etc.
